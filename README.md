# Primary Dual Hybrid Gradient Algorithm for Convex Optimization Problems

The Primary Dual Hybrid Gradient Algorithm (PDHG) is demonstrated by solving a two player game for advantageous positions for each 
player.  This same algorithm would work with two different scoring matrices as long as a move has a loss for one and a gain for            another player (zero-sum game).  This is a central idea behind game theory.
